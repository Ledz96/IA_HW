H1

- proof of monotonicity/consistency:

we want h(x) <= d(x,y) + h(y)
Our worst case is the movement of length d which minimizes h(y). The distance towards the farthest destination city after our
movement (not necessarily the same as in the previous state) will at most decrease by d. In such a case, h(z) = d + h(x).
Otherwise, the movement will either decrease the max distance by a value < d, keep it the same or increase it, thus h(z) < d + h(x)


- underestimate of real cost:

In the worst case scenario, all the movements the agent has to take in order to complete all its tasks are lined up and face
the same direction. In this case, travelling the distance between the first and last cities allow it to complete all tasks in
one pass. However, the heuristic on the first state is not overestimated, being its estimated cost equal to the one needed
for the movement.
In all other scenarios, the real cost would be greater than the heuristic, as additional movements to the maximum-distance one
would be needed.


H2

- inductive proof of monotonicity/consistency:

base case: next movement is final movement
h(y) = 0 -> h(x) = d(x,y) -> h(x) <= d(x,y) + h(y)

inductive case:
we have the path z -> x -> y
and h(x) <= d(x,y) + h(y)
we want h(z) <= d(z,x) + h(x)

Our worst case is the movement of length d which minimizes h(x). The distance towards the farthest task after our movement (not
necessarily the same as in the previous state) will at most decrease by d. In such a case, h(z) = d + h(x).
Otherwise, the movement will either decrease the max distance by a value < d, keep it the same or increase it, thus h(z) < d + h(x)
